    "The determinant of a product is a property that relates the determinants of two matrices with the determinant of their product. Specifically, if you have two square matrices A and B of the same size (n x n), then the determinant of their product (AB) is equal to the product of their determinants. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "det(AB) = det(A) * det(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "This property is useful in various contexts, such as solving linear systems of equations, finding the inverse of a matrix, and many other applications in linear algebra and its related fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof of this property can be derived using the definition of the determinant in terms of sums over permutations, or by using properties of the Levi-Civita symbol in tensor notation. However, the proof can be quite involved and may require a good understanding of the underlying concepts in linear algebra."
